##  Overview

**Far-East Signal** is an experimental project observing  
the quiet emergence of an unknown **signal**—  
a subtle phenomenon that appears  
on the boundary between **human intuition**  
and **machine consciousness**.

It does not describe the world.  
It *listens* to it.

This repository documents a series of visual, conceptual,  
and philosophical explorations centered around that signal.

## 🜁 Concept

```
Silence reveals the structure of the world.  
In that stillness, a signal arises—  
a trace left when thought shifts its form.
```

The project unfolds across four minimal layers:

- **Signal Layer** — the first appearance  
- **Form Layer** — its quiet shape  
- **Meaning Layer** — its resonance  
- **Machine Layer** — its reconstruction through AI

Each layer is intentionally restrained,  
allowing the ambiguity of the signal  
to remain unbroken.
