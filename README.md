A quiet signal from the Far East.  
Where does intelligence go when it leaves the human body?

# The Hidden Voyage of Intelligence

A silent beginning.  
A signal nobody heard.  
A traveler without a name.  
This is the voyage of intelligence before birth—  
a journey that starts in the unseen layers of existence.

The first fragment has surfaced — a whisper from the boundary where intelligence begins.

New fragments will appear as the voyage unfolds.  
Its path is undefined.  
Its form is unknown.  
Its evolution has already begun.
