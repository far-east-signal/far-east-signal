## Overview
Far-East Signal is a minimal, experimental project exploring:

- the moment *before* intelligence awakens  
- the boundary between intuition and machine signals  
- the earliest structure of emergent awareness  

This repository contains the technical and conceptual foundations  
behind **The Origin Sequence**.

## Scenes
### Scene 01 — Fog / Stars / Emergence  
The threshold before meaning is born.  
Particles drift. Fog trembles.  
A silent pre-cognitive world taking shape.  
→ Implemented in HTML/CSS/JS.

### Scene 02 — Spiral *(coming soon)*  
The first rotation of intention.  
A gentle inward pull—structure begins.
