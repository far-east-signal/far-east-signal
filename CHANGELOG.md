conceptual backbone of Far-East Signal.

### Improved

### Notes
v1.0 marks the point where conceptual narrative,
visual presentation, and technical implementation
form a coherent whole.  
All future releases (v1.1+) will extend either the
visual engine, the Origin Sequence, or the narrative depth.
